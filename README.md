# 3-D-DESIGNING
Beginner SOLIDWORKS project: hex nut with internal threading and recorded design process.
🔩 Hex Nut – My First 3D Model in SOLIDWORKS
Welcome! This repository documents a key milestone in my learning journey into 3D mechanical design using SOLIDWORKS.

<!-- Optional: Add a GIF or image if available -->

🎥 Project Overview
Over the past few weeks, I’ve begun exploring the world of CAD and 3D modeling. This project is my very first design: a hex nut modeled completely from scratch. While simple in geometry, it represents a foundational leap in understanding 3D design principles.

This repository includes:

🎞️ A screen recording of the design process (recorded with OBS Studio)

📐 The SOLIDWORKS part file (.SLDPRT)

📝 Design breakdown and what I learned

🛠️ What’s Inside
Screen Capture (MP4)
A quick look into my modeling process in real-time, recorded using OBS Studio.

3D Hex Nut Model
Fully parametric design with:

Revolved base geometry

Internal thread cut feature

Standard dimensions and constraints applied

💡 Key Concepts I Learned
✔️ Sketching and Revolving
✔️ Internal Threading with Cut Features
✔️ Applying Dimensional Constraints
✔️ Navigating the 3D Workspace Efficiently

🧠 Why It Matters (Even for Simple Models)
This model helped me understand:

How dimensional accuracy matters in real-world design.

The basics of parametric modeling.

How CAD helps visualize and communicate ideas clearly.

Early detection of potential fit or tolerance issues in assemblies.

🚀 What’s Next
I'm just getting started! My learning goals include:

Building multi-part assemblies

Experimenting with mechanical motion

Diving into basic simulation and rendering
